# Project 2 - Ames Iowa Housing Price Prediction and Kaggle Challenge

## Problem Statement

The Ames Housing Dataset was introduced by Professor Dean De Cock in 2011. It contains 2051 observations of housing sales in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010. There are 23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 21 continuous variables describing each houseâ€™s size, quality, area, age, and other miscellaneous attributes.

Real estate is a tangible asset made up of property and the land on which it sits. Housing price ranges are of great interest for both buyers and sellers. People looking to buy a new home tend to be more conservative with their budgets and market strategies. 

Therefore, it is important to investigate:
1. What are the features that will value-add a home and increase its sales price
2. The predicted sales price of a home if a combination of features is given
3. Likewise, predict feature combinations based on a given budget

The above questions will be interested by audience such as home buyers, home owners planning/not planning to sell their homes and property agents.

In this project, I will use Ames housing data to create linear regression models that predicts the price of houses in Ames, Iowa.

The types of models that will be created are linear Regression, ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net. The best model will be selected for housing price prediction investigations mentioned.

The success of the model will be determined by the root mean squared error (RMSE) value. It is a measure of how accurately the model predicts the sales price. Lower values of RMSE indicate better fit.

This project will demostrates:
1. Data Inspection & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Preprocessing
4. Feature Engineering
5. Modeling and Regularization Interpretation
6. Recommendations of value-added features based on research and modeling results


## Executive Summary

The purpose of this project is to select an appropriate model to predict sales price of homes in Ames Iowa. This model can benefit 3 groups of people, namely, home buyers who want to buy a value-for-money ideal home, home sellers who wanted to maximise profit when selling a house and property agents who wanted to close transactions efficiently. 

The model selected was Lasso model, it identified homes can be sold at higher price if they were bigger, better overall quality which includes heating (this is important as Ames experience severe winters), exterior, basement, fireplace and kitchen quality. Popular homes comes with more fireplaces, a masonry veneer area, poured concrete foundation, more rooms, more baths and bigger garage.

Homes that can sell at high prices is located at Northridge heights, which is described to be of low crime rate, near to a leisure park, 4 nearby schools, population growth rate of 523% and is suitable for retirement.

Homes that are brand new increases sales price. Likewise, price drop as age of the home increases.

The above predictions are important to home buyers, owners and property agents. By knowing what features is strongly linear correlated to sales price, they can make necessary improvement. Example, home owners can renovate, repaint, fix broken heating system, kitchens, basement to ensure the quality of homes for higher price. Home buyers can pioritize features of interest to keep within their budget. Home buyers can also ensure they do not overpay for a home by applying the model. Property agents on the other hand, can use the model to show potential clients whether that the house is worth buying and is it at a resonable price. This can help property agents to close deals more efficiently.

In this project, we are able to find out what are the features value-add a home and increase its sales price. This was addressed earlier at the top of this section. On top of this, we can predict the sales price based on a given set of features. Next, we can predict feature combinations based on a given budget. This can be done as the model generates a coefficent that can tell us how much sales price increase with a given unit change of the feature measurement.

Nevertheless, our predictions still have limitations:
- Sales price is highly impacted by economic climate, salary, occupation, employment rate, population demographics etc. Wider feature types is needed to be collected for more accurate real life prediction.
- Dataset scope is from 2006 to 2010, the prediction will be outdated for real life application. More recent dataset will be needed for current predictions.
- Further fine tuning eg data cleaning, reduce multi-collinearity, feature engineering and feature selection can be done to improve prediction capability.
- Prediction is applicable to Ames housing neighbourhood only. Not applicable to other neighbourhoods beyond Ames housing.

## Conclusion
Lets recap our problem statement!

**What are the features that will value-add a home and increase its sales price?**\
Based on our top 20 prodictors, we see total living area (basement + ground area) and garage area size being valued. Features like number of fireplaces, number of rooms, number of baths, with masonary veneer area and poured concrete foundation are important to buyers too. Overall house quality, kitchen quality, exterior quality, best basement finishing will also increase sales price. Better heating quality helped to increase the price due to severe winters in Ames county.

Brand new house fetch the best price. Price dropped linearly as age increase.
In specific, need to mention Northridge heights neighbourhood is the most popular choice and reasons were stated under research section.

**The predicted sales price of a home if a combination of features is given?**\
This is achieved by Kaggle competition submission whereby a test.csv containing its features were provided to predict the sales price using selected prediction model by the contestant. The model predicted sales prices were then feed into kaggle and compared against the actual. Kaggle will return the RMSE score based on actual sales price. My RMSE score is 33067. Further fine tuning eg data cleaning, reduce multi-collinearity, feature engineering and feature selection can be done to improve the scoring.

Model selected was lasso model. Standard deviation is low ~0.013. R2 is around ~0.86. Generally, all 4 models created perform very similarly. Lasso was chosen because it gives the best RMSE score on kaggle contest among the 4 models. Observed that elastic net has l1_ratio of 0.94. This shows lasso is dominant to suppress overfitting than Ridge.

**Predict feature combinations based on a given budget?**\
With the given budget, one can look up Top 20 predictors based on Lasso model. We can work backwards since we have the budget y and coefficient, to obtain various X features measurement in combinations. Example, the coefficient of overall quality is $12960.98, which means for every increase of 1 unit in overall quality, the price of the home will increase by 12960.98. By combining those features of interest and multiply by respective coefficients, we can obtain the sales price of a home within our budget

As mentioned, in Outside Research section, sales price is highly impacted by economic climate, salary, occupation, employment rate, population demographics etc. Wider feature types is needed to be collected for more accurate real like prediction.

Dataset scope is from 2006 to 2010, the prediction will be outdated for real life application. More recent dataset will be needed for current predictions.

Prediction is limited to Ames housing neighbourhood only. As the training dataset does not include other housing neighbourhood.


## Recommendations

**1. Home buyers**\
Bigger homes, poured concrete foundation, new homes, Northridge heights neighbourhood, with a masonary veneer area, bigger garage, bigger basement, more fireplaces will be more expensive. The prediction model can help to save time during house hunting and to ensure buyer did not overpay for a house. In addition, home buyers can also use the model to work out features of interest alongside with their budget constraints.

**2. Home owners**\
It was recommended to improve the home quality for the exterior, kitchen, fireplace, by renovating if the house is of bad condition or rundown. Repair the heating as well if it is not working. Repaint the walls if needed. Maintain the home to at least functioning condition. Remodelling can also be done to increase the living area.

**3. Property agents**\
Property agent can use my model to recommend appropriate homes that is within buyer's budget. This will save time for the client during house hunting. Property agent can also use the model to present the selling/buying price to clients, so convince them that the price is reasonable. This can help to close deals at a faster rate.
